        <p>Publius Horatius Cocles was an officer in the army of the early Roman Republic who famously defended the Pons
            Sublicius from the invading army of Etruscan King Lars Porsena of Clusium in the late 6th century BC.</p>
        <p>He was a nephew of the consul, Marcus Horatius Pulvillus, and is said to have obtained his agnomen
            (nickname), Cocles, meaning "one-eyed", because he lost an eye in the Battle of the Sublician Bridge.</p>
        <p>Horatius was a junior guard on the bridge when a sudden assualt by King Lars' men began. Horatius and two
            other defenders stood their ground on the bridge despite being
            ordered to retreat, using the bodies of fallen enemies as part of their shield wall. Horatius commanded the
            men to destroy the bridge behind him, fighting off enemies and
            suffering multiple injuries until the bridge was destroying, thwarting the Etruscan army's advance. Once the
            bridge was destroyed, he leaped into the river swimming across to escape with his life.</p>
